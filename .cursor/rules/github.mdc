## 1. Create‑Before‑Code

* **MUST** create a GitHub Issue for every non‑trivial task (≥ 10 lines of code or config).
* Use `gh issue create --title "<concise action>" --body "<goal / acceptance criteria>" --label "ai-task"`.
* Include context‑link back to the originating prompt or reference.

## 2. Granular Task Sizing

* Break large work into issues estimated ≤ 4 hours of agent effort.
* Cross‑link parent/child issues via `gh issue comment <id> "Tracks #<child>"`.

## 3. Progress Logging

* On **start** of work: `gh issue comment <id> "⏳"`.
* After each meaningful commit: `git commit -m "<feat|fix>: <summary> (refs #<id>)"` then push.
* Use `gh issue comment` to post logs or blockers. Prefix with emojis:

  * `🚧` Work in progress
  * `❗` Need input
  * `✅` Completed sub‑task

## 5. Closing the Loop

* When work is complete: `gh issue close <id> --comment "✅ Done."`
* CI must reference closed issues for auditability.

## 7. Fallback / Errors

* If `gh` command fails, log the full stderr in the issue comment `❗ gh error`. Retry twice max.
* If GitHub API outage detected, pause work and comment `⚠️ GitHub outage – pausing`.

## 8. Security & Secrets

* Never include credentials, tokens, or personal data in issues or comments.
* Redact log output before posting.

## 9. Style Reminders

* Follow repo coding conventions 
* Each PR **must** pass lint + unit tests before closing the issue.
