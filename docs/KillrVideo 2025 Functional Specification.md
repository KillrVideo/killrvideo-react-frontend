# KillrVideo 2025 Functional Specification

**Version:** 1.0 **Date:** May 9, 2025

## 1\. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose

This document outlines the functional requirements for KillrVideo 2025 and describes the application's features, capabilities, and user interactions. The primary goal of KillrVideo 2025 is to serve as an AI-ready reference application, demonstrating best practices for building modern, scalable video platforms.

### 1.2. Vision

To deliver a lean, AI-enhanced reference application that showcases how to combine modern database technologies with familiar application development stacks effectively.

### 1.3. Goals

* Provide a platform for users to discover, watch, rate, and comment on video content.  
* Enable content creators to share and manage their videos easily.  
* Implement moderation capabilities to ensure content integrity.  
* Offer AI-driven video recommendations to enhance user engagement.  
* Ensure a straightforward setup and deployment experience for developers exploring or extending the application.

### 1.4. Scope

This specification covers the core functionalities planned for KillrVideo 2025's version 1.0. The "Future Considerations" section outlines future enhancements and integrations.

## 2\. User Personas and Key Journeys

The system is designed to cater to the following user personas, each with distinct interaction patterns:

| Persona | Key Journey |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Viewer(App)** | Search for videos → Select and watch a video → Rate the video → Post a comment → Discover recommended videos. |
| **Creator(App)** | Sign in to the platform → Add a new video by providing a YouTube URL → View automatic thumbnail and embedding generation → Track view counts for their uploaded videos. |
| **Moderator(App)** | Sign in to the platform → List content that has been flagged by users → Inspect the reason for flagging (initially masked) → Unmask the reason (requires specific permissions) → Take appropriate moderation action (e.g., remove content, unflag). |
| **Enterprise Dev(End User)** | Clone the application's source code repository → Follow setup instructions → Run the application locally or deploy to a cloud environment → Examine sample code for integration into their own services. |

* **FR-MO-005:** Moderators shall be able to act on flagged content, such as unflagging or removing it (details of removal are TBD post-v1).

## 4\. Data Requirements (High-Level)

The application will need to manage and persist the following types of information:

* **User Data:** User identifiers, profile information (e.g., name, email), authentication credentials.  
* **Video Data:** Unique video identifiers, uploader's user ID, title, description, descriptive tags, the original YouTube video ID, and vector embeddings representing the video's content features.  
* **Comment Data:** Unique comment identifiers, associated video ID, commenter's user ID, the text of the comment, and a pre-calculated sentiment score.  
* **Rating Data:** Association between a video, a user, and the rating given. Aggregated rating counts and total rating scores per video.  
* **Playback Statistics Data:** View counts per video.  
* **Moderation Data:** Information on flagged content (e.g., video ID), the user who flagged it, the masked reason for flagging, the current moderation status, and the moderator who actioned it.  
* **Video List Data:** Data to support chronological listing of videos (e.g., "latest videos").

## 5\. External System Interfaces

KillrVideo 2025 will interact with the following external services or systems:

* **YouTube:** For sourcing video content, thumbnails, and embedding.  
* **Embeddings Generation Service (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere):** For generating vector embeddings from video metadata (title, description, tags) during video submission and for search queries. This is essential for AI-powered recommendation and search features.  
* **(Optional) Identity Provider (OIDC):** This is for potential future integration with external authentication systems.  
* **CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions):** For automated building, testing, and deployment processes (primarily a development-time dependency).

## 6\. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1. Performance

* **NFR-PE-001:** Developer setup for the cloud-connected path should take less than 10 minutes.  
* **NFR-PE-002:** When running against the free tier of the target cloud database, the system should aim to support at least 100 requests per second for core data API operations.

### 6.2. Security

* **NFR-SE-001:** All client-server communication shall be over HTTPS.  
* **NFR-SE-002:** Application secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials) shall be managed via environment variables or a secure secrets management system (details TBD, `.env` for local development).  
* **NFR-SE-003:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) shall be implemented to restrict access to sensitive operations, specifically the unmasking of moderation reasons.

### 6.3. Usability (Developer Focus)

* **Advanced Analytics & Business Intelligence:** Integration with data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark) for deeper analysis of user behavior and content performance.  
* **Ecosystem Event Integrations:** Publishing and/or consuming events with messaging systems (e.g., Apache Pulsar, Apache Kafka) for microservice choreography or real-time updates.  
* **Direct File Uploads & Transcoding:** With server-side transcoding capabilities, creators can upload video files directly to the platform.  
* **Automated Content Processing:** Features such as automatic translation of video titles/descriptions or generation of subtitles.  
* **Hybrid Rich Media Search:** Advanced search capabilities combining vector similarity and traditional keyword search across video content, potentially including transcript analysis (RAG \- Retrieval Augmented Generation).
